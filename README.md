# HW5_PyBer_Analysis

## Overview

This analysis is be perfromed on PyBer data to determine difference in markets based on city type.  Those tpes are Urban, Suburban, and Rural.  By analyzing this data, wise business decisions can be made to improve profitability across various market or city types.  This data is provided from ride_data and city_data csv files that are merged to make a more complete dataset. 

## Results

* ### Summary Table of Data 

![]()

In the summary table above, it can be seen that the Average Fare and the Average Fare per Driver are both highest for Rural cities.  It is also true that there are far more Urban rides, drivers and fare revenue.  In all categories Suburban data falls between Rural and Urban information.

* ### Total Fares by City Type

The plot above for the 1st 4 months of 2019 shows that Weekly Revenue is consistently higher than Suburban and Rural revenue.  Again Suburban revenue is between Rural and Urban total fares collected.

## Summary

### 1.  Potential for Rural Growth

  * The number are fares for rural area is very low.  Some advertizing in these area is not only very affordable it also can have a large impact with the [$34.62 mean fare](https://github.com/ethiry99/HW5_PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/rural_mean_fare.png). 

### 2.  Over Saturation of Urban Drivers

  * With an Average Fare per Driver of $16.57 it appears there is a [surplus of Urban drivers](https://github.com/ethiry99/HW5_PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/driver_surplus.png).  It may be time to ease off on new driver bonuses, and recruitment expenses.    

### 3.  Suburban Opportunity
 
  * The suburbs generate just over [26% more revenue per fare](https://github.com/ethiry99/HW5_PyBer_Analysis/blob/main/analysis/suburban_opportunites.png).  There are also less early adapters to ride share in the Suburbs than Urban areas.  One opputuniy to market to Subarban customers is highlighting that there is no need to find parking or parallel park.  In my experience since there isn't much need to parallel park in the suburbs they are out of practice and get nervous when they have to do it!
